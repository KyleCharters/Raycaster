# Raycaster
This is a little raycasting engine/game I wrote from scratch with Pygame
for a grade 10 compsci project several years back.

Includes:
A fully featured level editor with changable texture packs.

Minimaps & mazes

Of course, projectiles...

& more.


Should just run... :shrug:
```
➜ pip3 install easygui pygame
➜ python3 main.py
```
